# Axis-Modern 2

Axis-Modern 2 packages the complete redesign of the Axis website as a standalone site bundle. All site files now live under the `Axis-Modern-2/` directory so the project can be initialized as a fresh repository with the modern experience out of the box.

## Getting Started
1. Navigate into the `Axis-Modern-2/` directory.
2. Initialize a new git repository if desired: `git init`.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with your preferred static web server.

## Contents
- `assets/`: Compiled CSS, JavaScript, fonts, and imagery for the redesigned experience.
- HTML pages: The full suite of marketing, services, projects, news, careers, and contact pages that share the unified design.
- `PATCH_NOTES.md`: Original patch notes retained for context.

## Attribution
This bundle is derived from the Axis redesign approved for the "Axis-Modern 2" repository request.
